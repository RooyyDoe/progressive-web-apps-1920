## Application description

In the start screen of my product users are presented with a list of all gaming genres. The user can select a genre out of this list that the user wants to know more about by clicking on it. The user is then directed to a new page where all the games within the selected genre are presented in a list in the same way as the genres were previously. The games within the selected genre are obtained using an RAWG API. The user is now able to select one of these games in the list to obtain more detailed information about it. When a certain game is selected, the user will be navigated to a new page with all sorts of details about the game.
